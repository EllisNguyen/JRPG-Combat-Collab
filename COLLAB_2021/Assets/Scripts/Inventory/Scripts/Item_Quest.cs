    Custom behaviours like: (example)
    -Can't dismantle this item (can't progress the quest if the item is no longer in the inv, could be a big prob).
    -Some item can execute a custom function, like player can read a scroll quest item, or can activate a lantern to see in the dark, etc.
    -Dialogue display on-screen when player interact with the item.
